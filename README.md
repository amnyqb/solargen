## Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting solar power generation using weather data from two solar plants. The primary objective is to accurately predict the Direct Current (DC) power generated by these plants using different machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is available at [Kaggle Solar Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data). It contains four files:
- Plant 1 Generation Data
- Plant 1 Weather Data
- Plant 2 Generation Data
- Plant 2 Weather Data

Each file includes detailed information on DC power output, temperature (ambient and module), and solar irradiation, collected over several months.

## Approach
The project follows a structured approach:

1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Conclusion

## Required Packages
The analysis uses several R packages, including:
- prophet
- tensorflow
- randomForest
- caret
- lubridate
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- corrplot
- ggcorrplot
- rpart
- kableExtra

## Data Processing
- The data is loaded from CSV files.
- The DATE_TIME column is converted to a proper datetime format.
- New features are extracted, such as hour of the day, day of the week, and whether the date falls on a weekend.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA includes visualizations of:
1. Distribution of DC Power
2. DC Power vs Ambient Temperature
3. DC Power vs Irradiation
4. Correlation heatmap
5. DC Power Distribution by Hour of Day

## Models
Two main models are implemented and compared:

1. Random Forest
2. XGBoost

Both models are trained on features including AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE, MODULE_TEMPERATURE, IRRADIATION, hour, and day_of_week.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters for both Random Forest and XGBoost models are tuned to optimize performance.

## Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Visualizations comparing predicted vs actual values are provided for better interpretation.

## Results and Conclusion
The project compared several models for predicting solar power generation. Here are the RMSE results for each model:

## Results and Conclusion
The project compared several models for predicting solar power generation. Here are the RMSE results for each model:

| Model               | RMSE     |
|---------------------|----------|
| Random Forest       | 208.3862 |
| XGBoost             | 210.6839 |
| Tuned Random Forest | 207.9541 |
| Tuned XGBoost       | 208.1723 |

The tuned Random Forest model performed slightly better than the others, with the lowest RMSE of 207.9541. However, all models showed similar performance, with RMSE values around 208-210.

These results suggest that both Random Forest and XGBoost are effective in predicting solar power generation, with Random Forest having a slight edge in this particular dataset. The hyperparameter tuning process helped improve the performance of both models, albeit marginally.

Future work could involve:
1. Exploring other machine learning algorithms or deep learning models.
2. Incorporating more features or external data sources to improve prediction accuracy.
3. Investigating the model's performance on different time scales (e.g., hourly vs daily predictions).
4. Analyzing the impact of seasonal variations on model performance.
